The players search screen displays all the players in the game. The view provides a way to display a variety of information such as goals, contract information, value, wage, and position.

Search

Players can be search by first, second, common or combined first and second name. The search function will attempt to match any string within the name.

Filter

Filtering players is possible from the player filter dialog, and allows player skills, contract, position and age filtering. To reset the view to the default setup, press the 'Reset' button.

Context Menu

Right-clicking on each player produces a context menu allowing players to be bought, loaned, adding to or removing from the shortlist, or checking for scout recommendations.
