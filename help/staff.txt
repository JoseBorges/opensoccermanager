Staff are important to the running of a successful team and improving the squad with suitable players.

Coaches

A coach provides a way to both maintain and improve a players skill, as well as run training sessions effectively and recover player fitness. There are a variety of coach types of differing quality levels. The better a coach is at his job, the higher wages he will demand.

Scouts

Scouts allow a manager to determine the kind of players required, as well as helping to spot young emerging talent from other clubs. Scouts can be used to analyse individual players or to recommend a range of suitable players. They can also be used to provide information on the opposition.
