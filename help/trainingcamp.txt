Training camps are a way to boost player training and/or improve morale among players. There are a number of options which can be used to balance the cost along with the training and morale impacts.

Days - The number of days ranges between one and five days, with more days increasing the cost of the trip.

Quality - The quality determines the rating of the hotel and facilities on the trip, with the increased quality improving morale.

Location - Trips abroad have a minimum two day requirement. They also improve morale moreso than trips in the home country.

Purpose - There are three options; Leisure, Schedule, and Intensive. The leisure option provides a relaxing, minimal training holiday designed to improve morale. The intensive option provides a gruelling, high-work trip which is designed to maximise training. The schedule option gives a combination of both, and utilises the usual team training schedule.

Squad - The number of players to take can also be customised. The first team option takes both the current selected starting eleven and the five substitutes. The reserves can be taken separately, particularly for morale boosting trips. Alternatively, the entire team can be taken.

The cost of the trip increases with the various options. The cost per player indicates how much the selected trip will cost for a single player, while the final total takes into account the number of players which will be attending.
