Loan

A loan can be used to quickly inject money into the club, typically in an emergency but also to finance other aspects. Loans are offered at varying interest rates, and can be paid back over a period of one to five years.

Overdraft

An overdraft provides a safety net against going into the red. The amount of overdraft used is charged at the originally agreed interest rate.

Stadium Improvement Grant

If the club matches a number of criteria, a stadium improvement grant may be available. Typically, the club needs to be financially weak, but form and attendances must be good over a sustained period. Money taken out as part of the grant must be spent within six months to improve stands and/or buildings. Failure to adequately spend the money may need to legal action.

Public flotation

Many clubs are privately owned, however a large fund of money can be supplied if the club is taken public. The amount of money depends on the state of the club such as form, reputation, and assets. Once a club has been taken public, it can not be made private again.
