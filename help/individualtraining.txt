Individual training is used to improve a particular attribute when specified by the player. Using (ideally) a specialist coach for the selected attribute, the player will begin to improve.

Improvements to skills take between weeks and months depending on the player. Typically, older players develop more slowly than younger players, however two players of the same age may improve at different rates.

Display

The Start Value column specifies the attribute value when training was started. Alternately, the Current Value states the attribute number as it currently stands. The Notes column states how the training is going. As time progresses, it is important to ensure that the player is still improving. If not, the player morale may be effected.

Customisation

Individual training can also be customised to some extent. The intensity can be increased to High which speeds up the rate of improvement at a greater risk of injury. Also, if left for a prolonged period, a players morale may also be effected by the high intensity training rate.
