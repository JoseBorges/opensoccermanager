Advertising is used to earn additional money from the club, by providing a way for companies to advertise in programmes and on hoardings positioned around the pitch.

On the left, is a current list of offers with the amount of time the advertising will be up for and the amount of money the company is willing to pay. When double-clicked or dragged-and-dropped, the advertising will be agreed and the club will be paid.

As the game continues, the period remaining will decrease. When no time is left on the advertising item, it will be removed.

Assistant

Managing the advertising is a job which needs to be kept up to, so a manager may wish to delegate the responsiblity to the assistant manager by clicking the Assistant button. Doing this will ensure that the advertising is purchased whenever possible.
