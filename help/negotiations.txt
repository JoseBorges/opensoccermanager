Negotations are entered when a player is to be purchased or sold. There are a number of stages which must be negotiated including negotiating the potential release, a fee (if the negotiation is a purchase), and agreeing the wage with the player.

At any time it is possible to cancel the negotiation and pull out of the opportunity to transfer a player.

When awaiting for a response from the opposition club, a message dialog will be displayed when an item is double-clicked. If a response has been received, the negotiation dialog will prompt for further action such as negotiating a wage or specifying a loan period.
